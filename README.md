# carapace
Reusable, core functionality for building a microservice.

**Definition:** _a bony or chitinous case or shield covering the back or part of the back of an animal (such as a turtle or crab)._

**Description:** A learning project to build the components of a microservice that are often covered handled 'under the hood' by frameworks such as Spring Cloud or Micronaut.  

* Like those projects, the intent is to make a reusable library for other projects down the line. 
* As the name suggests, there is a slant toward security and overall service hardening, ie, an exoskeleton that can house and provide functionality to, any operational/business logic.

## Library Components (thus far):
